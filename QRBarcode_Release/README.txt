==========================

Thank you for using QRBarcode! This document contains important information about installing, running, and maintaining your application.

Installation
-----------
1. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location
   - You can place the folder anywhere on your system
   - IMPORTANT: Once you run the application and create a database, DO NOT move the application folder
   - The database will be created in a 'databases' folder outside the application directory

2. First-Time Setup:
   - Run setup_dlls.bat as administrator (if you encounter any DLL-related issues)
   - The script will automatically detect your system architecture and install appropriate DLLs

Running the Application
---------------------
1. Regular Systems:
   - Double-click qrbarcode.exe to start the application
   - First run will create necessary database files

2. ARM Systems:
   - Use launch_arm.bat for optimal performance
   - This script includes special optimizations for ARM processors

Database Location
---------------
IMPORTANT: The application creates and maintains a SQLite database in:
%LOCALAPPDATA%\QRBarcode\databases\

- DO NOT move the application folder after database creation
- Database contains all your QR code data and settings
- If you need to move the application:
  1. Export any important data first
  2. Close the application
  3. Move the folder to the new location
  4. Run the application (it will create a new database)
  5. Import your data back

Updates
-------
Updates are performed manually:
1. Download the latest version from the releases page
2. Extract to a new location
3. Copy your database from %LOCALAPPDATA%\QRBarcode\databases to the new installation
4. Run the new version of the application

Note: Always back up your database before updating.

Troubleshooting
--------------
1. DLL Issues:
   - Run setup_dlls.bat as administrator
   - This script will automatically fix most DLL-related problems

2. Display Issues:
   - For ARM systems, use launch_arm.bat
   - Try pressing Alt+Tab if the window doesn't appear
   - Check the taskbar for hidden windows

3. Database Issues:
   - Ensure the application has write permissions to %LOCALAPPDATA%\QRBarcode
   - Do not modify the databases folder manually
   - Keep regular backups of important data

Technical Support
---------------

- Include the application version (found in About screen) in your reports
- Export logs using the diagnostic tools if requested

System Requirements
-----------------
- Windows 10 or later
- Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022
- Minimum 4GB RAM recommended
- 100MB free disk space for installation
- Additional space for database (varies with usage)
